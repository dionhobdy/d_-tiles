D_TILES is a tile component generator. The idea of the application is to create general use clickable tiles via Electron application. The user will be prompted to input a title of the tile, a sub-title, a color for a gradient overlay and a image to search for via Unsplash API.

The goal for this application is to generate clickable tiles on a webpage that is listening on a port of the user's choosing. Once the tile is generated a HTML/CSS code for the tile can be copy and pasted. Within the website, a delete feature would help users manage the tiles they created by removing tiles that the user will no longer want in their collection.
